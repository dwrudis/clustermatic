# /etc/clustermatic/fstab - This file is the fstab for nodes.
#
# Variables that will get substituted:
#  MASTER = IP address of the master node.  (good for doing NFS mounts)
#
# Note that the "noauto" and "user" options are meaningless here.
#
# The root file system is a tmpfs provided by the boot scripts.  You
# can mount something on / if you'd like but due to oddities in the file
# caching code it's not recommended right now.

# You can mount swap space like this....
#/dev/hda2	swap		swap	defaults	0 0

# /proc will be mounted by the boot-up stuff but you will want to add it
# here if you decide to run with a chrooted environment.
none		/proc		proc	defaults	0 0
none		/sys		sysfs	defaults	0 0
none		/bpfs		bpfs	defaults	0 0

# NFS (for example)
#MASTER:/home	/home		nfs	nolock	0 0
