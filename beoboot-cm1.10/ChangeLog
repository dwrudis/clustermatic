Changes from cm1.9 to cm1.10

	* Fixed vmadlib so that it link 32 bit or 64 bit libraries no
	matter how it's built.

	* Sucked in the cmconf stuff so it doesn't need an external
	library anymore.

	* Added option to say LINUX= to avoid trying to build the kernel
	module.

	* Updated device scanning code to use the "alias" lines that are
	part of the modinfo in new driver modules.

	* Updated scanning code to use sysfs instead of the stuff in
	/proc.  This is a cleaner and more device independent way of doing
	things.

	* Added support for scanning for stuff other than PCI.  Currently
	PCI and USB are supported.  Others should be easy to add.

	* Device scanning keeps happening even after RARPing has started.
	This should provide a rudimentary hot plug support.

	* Added --usb option to beoboot to suck in USB host drivers.

	* Changed makefiles to keep install directories sane on multiple
	architectures.

	* Added working kmod.so module for node_up.  It's a little
	different than before.  It's no longer wired to fetch since that
	can put a lot of load on the front end.  All modules to be loaded
	must be provided on the command line.

	* Removed pciprobe module.  If this is implemented again, it will
	have to be significantly different than before since we're not
	dealing in our own lists of PCI ids.

	* Added patch to make rc script automatically stop/restart bjs if
	it's running.  Thanks Michal Jaegermann.

	* Added fix so that nodeinfo will pickup cpu MHz and processor
	count on AMD64.  Thanks Michal Jaegermann.

	* Added a patch to fix setting of broadcast addresses from Michal
	Jaegermann.

	* Deprecated the use of rc.clustermatic for setting addresses on
	network interfaces.  It replicates existing configuration provided
	by whatever distribution this is running on.

	* Added patch from Michal Jaegermann to allow you to override the
	kernel version on the beoboot command line.

	* Made insmod and modprobe equivalent.  They pretty much were anyway.

	* Small changes to work with SuSE's kernel build system.

Changes from cm1.8 to cm1.9

	* Added kernel size over flow patch from Eric Biederman.

	* Moved phase2_last hook to be after the file system cleanup.

	* Fixed 'bootfile' so that the node argument works correctly with
	sparse node ranges.
	
	* Fixed default node number counting problems that forced people
	to explicitly specify node numbers in 'node' lines.

	* Fixed bug in node_up that would cause it to hang if it failed to
	create any child processes.

	* Added code to the GM plugin to try and set the GM host name on
	the node.  Note that this doesn't currently handle multiple units
	correctly.

	* Added "exec" node_up plugin from Joshua Aune of Linux Networx.

	* Ported to Linux 2.6.5

	* Changed initrds from romfs to cpio for Linux 2.6.5 initramfs.

	* Removed pci related configuration in favor of in-module PCI ids.

	* Added add El Torito (-e) as an output format on beoboot.

	* Removed libmodutils related goofiness from the node_up program.

Changes from cm1.7 to cm1.8
	
	* Fixes for architecture mixups on x86-64.  This is a confusing
	case because you use a 32-bit phase 1.

	* Updated rc scripts so that they can work on SuSE as well as Red
	Hat and Yellowdog.

	* Added more path mangling for x86_64 and SuSE.

Changes from cm1.6 to cm1.7

	* Added support in node_up.conf to ignore failure of specific
	plugins.  (Add "failok" prefix to a plugin line in node_up.conf)

	* Fixed bug in module dependency code in "beoboot" that could
	cause modules to get left out when building boot images.  This
	code also got a general cleanup.

	* Changed default configuration directory from /etc/beowulf to
	/etc/clustermatic.

	* Changed the "service" name to "clustermatic".

	* Added an errno stub to fix linking problems on Red Hat 9.
	(libmodutils is linked against a different libc on RH9.)  This
	should be harmless when using any recent glibc.

	* Changed the default configuration directory from /etc/beowulf to
        /etc/clustermatic.  (Yes, we re-branded this thing yet again...)

Changes from cm 1.5 to cm 1.6

	* Fixed default permissions on /.

	* Fixed vmadlib node_up plugin bug which caused the ldconfig code
	to ignore some libraries.

	* Fixed a problem with the initrd image not being freed on the
	slave node.

	* Removed remnants of file caching stuff.

	* Modified RARP daemon to allow for sparse node ranges.  The
	"nodes" configuration option is no longer required.

	* Added "ifdup" node_up module from
	Joshua Aune <luken@linuxnetworx.com>

	* Added retry with backoff behavior to NFS mounts in the setupfs
	node_up module.

	* Updated GM plugin for GM2.  (It only works on GM 2 now)

	* Fixed bug in miscfiles - it didn't reset ignore_missing and
	follow_symlink every time.  Thanks Larry Baker <baker@usgs.gov>

	* Modified beoboot to try and automatically figure out which
	modules should be included in the boot image based on the PCI
	table and what's in /lib/modules/kernel/drivers/net.  The
	bootmodule option can still force additional modules to be added.
	Also, this behavior can be turned off with --noautomod.

	* Modified the "nodeinfo" node_up module to use to use bpfs file
	attributes instead of /var/beowulf/nodeinfo.  The nodeinfo library
	is no longer required.

	* Fixed a few file descriptor leaks in the boot program.
	
Changes from cm 1.4 to cm 1.5

	* Fixed setupfs problem which prevented mounts from physical
	devices from working.  Patch from Willem Schreuder
	<willem@prinmath.com>

	* Fixed problem in the multicast sender that could cause clients
	(slave nodes) to get stuck requesting the same file over and over
	again.

	* Added a node_up module to set sysctl options.

	* Updated the GM module to set the GM host name.

	* Fixed a nodeup bug that would cause it to spin if new nodeup
	connections come in while a bunch of nodeup processes are running.

	* Slowed down "." printing during RARP to keep console logging on
	large clusters sensible.

	* Added a hook system to make adding system specific stuff
	(e.g. our GM route requester) to the boot program easy.  Note that
	this stuff is still in its infancy and will probably be modified
	somewhat before becoming permanent.

	* Replaced the multicast boot image download scheme with a tree
	based unicast image downloader.

	* Added some back-off on RARP requests to try and keep from
	hammering networks too hard.

	* Fixed beoboot problem that could cause symlinks to be copied as
	symlinks when collecting modules for boot images.

	* Removed threading from the node setup server - improved
	performance as a result.

	* Removed phase "3" bogosity and provided both phase 1 & 2 with a
	writable root filesystem.  Note that phase 1 now requires tmpfs
	support in the kernel.

Changes from lanl 1.3 to cm 1.4

	* Added "nodeadd" program (/usr/lib/beoboot/bin) to facilitate
	automagically adding new nodes to /etc/beowulf/config.

	* Removed configuration reading and node database code.  That code
	is now part of "cmtools".  cmtools is now required to build
	beoboot.

	* Squashed errors from find in rc.beowulf.  This was mostly to
	hide the non-existent library case.

Changes from lanl 1.2 to lanl 1.3

	* Replaced giant and hideously ugly "node_up" shell script with a
	plug-in style program and collection of modules.  This minimizes
	the number of processes and process migration at boot time.

	* Cleaned up some of the multicast send/receive code a bit.  It's
	still a big hack.

	* Fixed a beoboot bug which caused it to not find modules required
	for the boot image if symlinks are involved.

Changes from lanl 1.1 to lanl 1.2

	* Fixed a two kernel monte issue with protected mode operation and
	succesfully finding the real mode setup code.  MONTE_PROTECTED
	unfortunately requires a kernel patch in the first kernel now.

	* Removed most of the BProc dependencies.

	* Made kver statically linked to reduce the problems.

	* Added chkswap improvements from Rick Niles <niles@scyld.com>

	* Added in some script updates from Scyld.

	* Added in supermon support at image build time.

	* Reworked make files to allow for no two kernel monte support.
	(i.e. on ppc)

Changes from lanl 1.0 to lanl 1.1

	* Fix permission problems with multicast file transport.  It now
	preserves permissions and file ownership.  This changed the
	protocol a bit.

	* Added support for selecting a boot image based on node number.
	The bootfile directive now accepts a node number or range of node
	numbers (i.e. 5-10,12) before the boot file name.

	* Fixed misc script problems arrising from multiple MAC addresses.

Changes from Scyld beoboot 1.1.16 to beoboot-lanl 1.0
	* Matches BProc 3.1.2

	* Support for multicast file transfer w/ the BProc 3.1.x file
	request mchanism.

	* Support in daemons for new configuration language which allows
	multiple IP addresses per node and multiple MAC addresses per
	node.

	* Alpha support in Two Kernel Monte.

	* Many small bugfixes in the "beoboot" script.

	* Updated and cleaned up for Linux 2.4.x - many small bugfixes.

	* tmpfs is used wherever possible during node boot.

	* Version checking on RARP requests to avoid answering requests
	for other architectures, etc.

	* mkbootimg produces different images - multi-architecture capable
	not and not nearly as bad an intel-only kludge.
