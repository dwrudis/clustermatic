# Sample BProc / Clustermatic Configuration file

# The configuration directives in this file are described in

# interface interfacename
# The interface command tells the BProc master daemon and the beoserv
# daemon to listen for connections on a particular interface.  If
# multiple interface lines appear in the file, the daemons will listen
# on multiple interfaces.
#
interface eth1

# bprocport nodenumber
# The bprocport command tells the BProc master daemon which TCP port
# it should listen on for connections from slave machines.  Only one
# bprocport command is allowed.  The master daemon will listen on this
# port on all interfaces.  The default value is 2223
#
# bprocport 2223

# master hostname[:port] ...
# The master command lists the addresses for master nodes in the
# system.  These lists of addresses will be sent to slave nodes so
# that they will find all the master nodes in the system.  There
# should be exactly one master line for every master node in the
# system.  Each master can have more than one address.  Slave nodes
# will attempt to connect to each address on the list in order.  It is
# accept­ able for a master node to have a line for itself.  This
# should be a no-op since the slave should see that it is already
# connected to that master.
#
# master master1
# master master2

# pingtimeout seconds
# The pingtimeout command controls how frequently the BProc master and
# slave daemons will ping one another to make sure they're still
# alive.  This value is propaged to the slave machines when they
# connect to the master.
#
# pingtimeout 30

# ip [nodenumber] IPaddress1 ...
# The ip assigns one or more IP addresses to a single node.  If the
# nodenumber argument is given, the IP address will be assigned to
# that node.  If it is omitted, it will be assigned to the node
# following whatever node was assigned last.  If no nodes have been
# assigned, assignment will start with node zero.  IP addresses must
# be in dotted notation.  (ie. 10.0.0.1) No hostnames are allowed.
#
# ip 0 10.1.1.1
# ip 10.1.1.1

# iprange [nodenumber] IPaddress1 IPaddress2
# The iprange assigns addresses IPaddress1 up to and including
# IPaddress2 to nodes.  If the nodenumber argument is given, the first
# address will be assigned to that node, the next address to the next
# node and so on.  If the nodenumber argument is omitted, the
# addresses will be assigned starting with the node following whatever
# node was assigned last.  If no nodes have been assigned, assignment
# will start with node zero.
#
iprange 0 10.0.0.10 10.0.0.17   # Nodes 0-8 have addresses from this range.

# slave timesync yes|no
# If slave timesync is set to yes then the master daemon will include
# time stamps in the BProc ping messages.  The slave daemons will use
# these time stamps to keep the slave daemon reasonably synchro­ nized
# with the master node.  The default value is yes.
#
# slave timesync yes

# slave privatefs yes|no
# If the slave privatefs flag is set to yes.  Then the slave daemon
# will create a private file system namespace for itself.  The root
# file system will be a tmpfs file system.  It and everything under it
# will be automatically unmounted when the slave is disconnected from
# the master.  The default value is no.
#
# slave privatefs no

# The slave node boot file.
#
#
bootfile /var/clustermatic/boot.img

# Library list
#
# This tells beoboot which libraries to put on the node at boot time.
#
# The "librariesfrombinary" lines instruct beoboot to inspect a binary
# and generate a a library list from that.
#
# The "libraries" lines explicitly include libraries.  Note that you
# must add the real file to the list - NOT the symlink to the real
# file.  Globbing is allowed here.
#
# For both directives: Any file which doesn't exist will be silently
# ignored.  Each may be used more than once to add to the list.

# Example:
librariesfrombinary /bin/sleep /bin/ps /bin/ping /bin/ls # get libc,resolver
libraries /usr/lib/libstdc++*   /usr/lib64/libstdc++*    # C++ support
libraries /usr/lib/libbproc.so* /usr/lib64/libbproc.so*  # BProc, of course.
libraries /lib/libnss_bproc*    /lib64/libnss_bproc*     # BProc resolver

# Other possible binaries to run a node.
# librariesfrombinary /sbin/mke2fs


# Here we assign MAC addresses to nodes.  Nodes can have multiple MAC
# addresses.  Here the optional "0" zero argument states that the address
# should be assigned to node zero.  Node lines following that will assign
# addresses to nodes sequentially
#
# The following are some examples:
#
#node 0 00:50:56:00:00:00
#node   00:50:56:00:00:01
#node   00:50:56:00:00:02
#node   00:50:56:00:00:03
#node   00:60:b0:a2:19:1a
#node   00:d0:09:63:42:57
#
#node 0 00:60:b0:a2:19:1a
#node   00:d0:09:63:42:57
#node   00:00:86:45:CD:14
#
#node   00:e0:81:3:47:55
