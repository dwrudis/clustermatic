To-do:

 * Error checking for large kernels built as small?

 * Check out this reboot notifier call chain thing.

Features:

 * Be able to read a kernel/initrd from a user's memory space.

 * Have some way of concatenating a kernel image and a ram disk image.

 * Grok VGA arguments to the kernel.  (This stuff seems totally hosed
   these days...)
